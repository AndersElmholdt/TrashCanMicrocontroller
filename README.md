# TrashCanMicrocontroller
Code for a series of arduinos, sending received data from sensors onto a computer via Serial USB.

The master code is for the arduino connected to the computer, whereas the slave code is for the rest. The slaves must be assigned a unique ID for everything to work as intended.

Includes the libraries needed.
